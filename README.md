I developed this game using GB Studio. If you unzip `files.zip` you will find the `assets` and `build` folders. `Final_Project.gbsproj` can be opened in GB Studio to view the game, just make sure the assets and build folder are in the same directory. `assets` contains all the game's assets, including backgrounds, sprites, and UI elements. `build` contains the html5 build of the game that is deployed at the Itch.io page.
